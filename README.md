👋 Hey there, I'm Khvllill!
🌟 Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile! 🌟

I love to build mobile and web apps that look good and work well. I work on my own using Flutter to make apps that run on different phones and Django/Flask to create strong backend systems. My tech journey has also taught me a lot about making websites and apps look great, mixing creativity with technical know-how.

I always want to learn more in this field that keeps changing. My work isn't just about writing code; it's about creating things that matter.

🎮 Coding for Fun 
When I'm not busy with work projects, I like to jump into coding challenges and try out new tech. For me, coding isn't just a job; it's a hobby I'm passionate about. I get a kick out of building small apps helping with open-source projects, and joining hackathons. Every project even the tiny ones, gives me a chance to pick up something fresh and exciting.
